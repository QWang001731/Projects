Partial-differential equation can be solved by numerical methods. 
But these methods usually require heavy computations and take long time to solve.
However, using multi-process and multi-threads parallel computing technique  could significantly reduce the computation time. 
This program use library omp and openMPI to execute computation in parallel and solve the advection equation.
